# 📓 Jupyter Notebook: Ad Campaign Optimization

This notebook contains the full implementation of the **Ad Campaign Optimization** project — a linear optimization model designed to maximize advertising exposure across magazines, newspapers, television, and radio 📺🗞️📻📰.

We formulate and solve a **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** problem using **CVXPY** to determine the optimal number of ad units to purchase per subcategory, under real-world budget and allocation constraints.

## 🧠 What's inside:
- 🔢 Hardcoded ad cost and exposure data
- 📊 Problem formulation and constraints
- 🧮 MILP solver using CVXPY
- ✅ Optimal solution: exposure, cost, and ad unit breakdown
- 📈 Visualizations of allocation and media impact

## 📌 How to use:
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run all cells to reproduce the results.
3. Review the visualizations and media allocation strategy.

## 🧰 Requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- `cvxpy`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install cvxpy numpy matplotlib
```
